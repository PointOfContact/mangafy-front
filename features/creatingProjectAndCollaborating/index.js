              MangaFY makes project management and collaboration on your web-comic or manga as
              simply and efficient as possible.
            </p>
            <p>Before finding your desired collaboration partner, you need to open up a project.</p>
            <h3>How to open a project on MangaFY?</h3>
            <p>
              First Enter MangaFY and open a project (free or paid collaboration). Once you are at
              your folder - click on the project you wish to start with:
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <br />
            <img src="/img/articleProjects.png" alt="MangaFy projects" />
            <img src="/img/articleCardStory.png" alt="MangaFy card story" />
            <p>
              After that, go to the <strong>STORYBOARD</strong> slide and begin to work on your
              project (story, characters, etc.) and you are also able to invite people to
              collaborate by pressing the <strong>FIND A PARTNER</strong> tab:
            </p>
            <h3>How to invite collaborations to your project on MangaFY.</h3>
            <img src="/img/articleCardStoryBoard.png" alt="MangaFy card story board" />
            <br />
            <p>
              This will open up the <strong>FIND A MEMBER</strong> section of the MangaFY community,
              allowing you to search for the relevant person you see fit for your project (be it a
              writer, illustrator, editor, translator, inker, etc.):
            </p>
            <br />
            <img src="/img/articleSearch.png" alt="MangaFy search" />
            <br />
            <p>
              Enter a members profile and invite them for a collaboration by pressing the
              <strong>INVITE TO COLLABORATE </strong> button:
            </p>
            <br />
            <img src="/img/articlePortfolio.png" alt="MangaFy portfolio" />
            <br />
            <p>
              Once pressed a window will open up so you can reach the member with what type of
              collaboration you are looking for. Once done - press <strong>SEND INVITE</strong>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <img
              className={styles.sendInvite}
              src="/img/articleSendInvite.png"
              alt="MangaFy send invite"
            />
            <br />
            <p>
              <b>Note:</b> it is important to fill out the "your message" section to keep it as
              personal and detailed as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once done, the member you shared an invite with will get both an{' '}
              <strong>EMAIL NOTIFICATION</strong>
              and an <strong>ALERT</strong> on site, notifying them of your reach.
            </p>
            <br />
            <img
              className={styles.notification}
              src="/img/articleNotification.png"
              alt="MangaFy notification"
            />
            <br />
            <p>
              Once they approved you will get notified as well and can begin communication and work
              on the project together.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can't wait to see what your collaborative efforts and team will achieve. Ready to
              work on your project?
