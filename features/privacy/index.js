                    is accessible to us by adjusting the account privacy settings on your Account
                    page or via certain privacy controls contained on a social media account you
                    have with a third party. MangaFY makes it easy for you to keep certain aspects
                    of your Personal Information accurate, complete, and up to date. To review or

                    part of the Platform that collects Personal Information, such as forms

                    obligations owed to and we do not believe it reasonably necessary to retain such
