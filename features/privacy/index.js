                      Like most website operators, Mangafy Lab collects non-personally-identifying
                      information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
                      available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and
                      the date and time of each visitor request. Mangafy Lab's purpose in collecting
                      non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Mangafy
                      Lab's visitors use its website. From time to time, Mangafy Lab may release
                      non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a
                      report on trends in the usage of its website.
                      <br />
                      Mangafy Lab also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
                      Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving
                      comments on https://mangafy.club blog posts. Mangafy Lab only discloses logged
                      in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses
                      and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

                      Certain visitors to Mangafy Lab's websites choose to interact with Mangafy Lab
                      in ways that require Mangafy Lab to gather personally-identifying information.
                      The amount and type of information that Mangafy Lab gathers depends on the
                      nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at
                      https://mangafy.club to provide a username and email address.

                      If you are a registered user of https://mangafy.club and have supplied your
                      email address, Mangafy Lab may occasionally send you an email to tell you
                      about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with
                      what's going on with Mangafy Lab and our products. We primarily use our blog
                      to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of
                      email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email
                      or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in
                      order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support
                      other users. Mangafy Lab takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect
                      against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
                      personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
