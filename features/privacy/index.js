                be required by us to provide the Services or be disclosed by you during your use of
                the Services. You will also be asked to create a user name and private password,

                with the Services, you voluntarily consent to the collection, use and disclosure of
                such personal information as specified in this Privacy Policy. The legal bases for
                our processing of personal information are primarily that the processing is
                necessary for providing the Services and that the processing is carried out in our
                legitimate interests, which are further explained below. Without limiting the
                foregoing, we may on occasion ask you to consent when we collect, use, or disclose
                your personal information in specific circumstances.<br></br>
                <br></br>We take steps designed to ensure that only those employees who need access
                to your personal information to fulfil their employment duties will have access to
                it. We may use and disclose your personal or account information for the following

                rights set forth in this Privacy Policy), including without limitation for the
                purpose of providing you with information about the Services, or informing you of
                changes or additions to the Services or of the availability of any other services or
                features we provide; <br></br>- To assess service levels, monitor traffic patterns
                and gauge popularity of different features and service options of the Site and/or
                Services; <br></br>- To enforce this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service;{' '}

                your account (if you have a paid account) and in order to process payments, Dribbble
                utilizes third party payment gateways, such as Stripe and Paypal, who will utilize
                your credit card and other payment information in accordance with their respective
                privacy policies. Dribbble shall not be liable to you or any other person for any

                applicable data protection policies.<br></br>
                <br></br>When we disclose your personal information to third parties, we take
                reasonable measures to ensure that the rules set forth in this Privacy Policy are

                appropriate technical and organisational measures.<br></br>
                <br></br>Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where
                we have facilities or in which we engage third party service providers. By using the
                Services, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside your
                country of residence, which may have different data protection rules than in your
                country. While such information is outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws of
                the country in which it is held, and may be subject to disclosure to the
                governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of such other country,
                pursuant to the laws of such country. However, our practices regarding your personal
                information will at all times continue to be governed by this Privacy Policy and, if
                applicable, we will comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)
                requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information
                from the EU/EEA to third country.<br></br>
                <br></br>We may occasionally communicate with you regarding our products, services,
                news and events. You have the option to not receive this information. We provide an
                opt-out function within all email communications of this nature, or will cease to
                communicate with you for this purpose if you contact us and tell us not to
                communicate this information to you. The only kind of these communications that you
                may not “opt-out” of are those required to communicate announcements related to the
                Services, including information specific to your Account, planned Services
                suspensions and outages. We will attempt to minimize this type of communication to
