                      of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the
                      deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in
                      a structured, electronic format. Below, we describe the tools and processes
                      for making these requests. You can exercise some of the choices by logging
                      into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your
                      account. Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see
                      “Notice to End Users” below), you may need to contact your administrator to
                      assist with your requests first. For all other requests, you may contact us as
                      provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.

                      <br />
                      Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if
                      fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if
                      you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by
                      law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. Where you have asked us
                      to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps,
                      you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have
                      your information deleted or otherwise restricted. If you have unresolved
                      concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in
                      the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were
                      infringed.

                      If you would like to delete an entire project, which is a collection of
                      multiple shots, log in to your account and scroll to the bottom of the
                      left-hand sidebar. Any projects you have will be listed; click on the project
                      you would like to delete. Once the new page loads scroll to the bottom of the

                      Please be aware that deleting your account does not delete your information;
                      your information remains visible to other Service users based on your past
                      participation within the Services. For more information on how to delete your
                      information, see below.

                      In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise
                      processing your information where you believe we don’t have the appropriate
                      rights to do so. For example, if you believe a Services account was created
                      for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can
                      request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. Where you gave
                      us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us
                      to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has
                      already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your
                      information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below. When
                      you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your
                      request. If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to
                      continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your
                      information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided
                      your administrator does not object (where applicable). If you object to
                      information about you being shared with a third-party app, please disable the
                      app or contact your administrator to do so.

                      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do so, we will send

                      alerting users who may not be subscribed. If the change materially affects the
