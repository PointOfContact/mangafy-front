              In order to choose the best self-publishing platform for your graphic novel, you
              should first learn about the two major types of platforms
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Do-it-yourself self-publishing platform</b>: This type of platform is exactly
                what it sounds like. In our opinion, DIY options are severely limiting for authors.
                You’ll need to handle all the pre-production stages yourself (or collaborate at
                MangaFY), including book cover design, editing, interior layout, marketing and more.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <b>One-stop shop self-publishing platform:</b> This platform will cover all your
                self-publishing needs under one company’s roof. This option is especially suitable
                for folks who either don’t have the time or inclination to do all the work
                themselves but still want to enjoy the benefits of self-publishing such as retaining
                their copyright and publishing rights and keeping creative control.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              Do you prefer to do everything on your own? If so, the do-it-yourself platforms are
              most likely ideal for you.
