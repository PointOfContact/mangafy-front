                    By accessing or using the Platform, you confirm that you unconditionally accept
                    these Terms and that you agree to fully comply with them. Please read these
                    Terms carefully before using the Platform. If you do not agree to these Terms,
                    please do not use the Platform and you are not granted permission to access,
                    view, or otherwise use the Platform for any purpose.

                    While some Content (as defined in the Content Policy and including but not
                    limited to the Works) and Intellectual Property (as defined below) on the

                    targets children younger than 13 years of age (a “Child” or “Children”), and
                    Children are not permitted to use the Platform. MangaFY strongly urges all
                    parents and legal guardians to monitor the Internet and mobile uses of Children.
                    Parents and legal guardians should be aware that there are parental control
                    tools available from other sources on the Internet that you can use to prevent
                    your children from accessing or submitting information online without parental
                    permission. If we learn that MangaFY has collected personal information of a
                    Child, MangaFY will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon
                    as commercially reasonably possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
                    that you are a parent or legal guardian and you nonetheless permit a Child to
                    use the Platform, you shall be solely responsible for monitoring your Child’s
                    use of the Platform and MangaFY shall have no liability regarding the same.

                    If you purchase access to any Works or otherwise pay us for any of Services, you
                    agree to pay us the stated fees for such Works or Services. Failure to pay these
                    fees may result in the termination of your access to the Works or Services. For
                    any recurring Services, we may store, and/or authorize a third party to store
                    (including, without limitation, Apple via the App Store or Google via the Play
                    Store), your payment method and continue to bill your payment method to avoid
                    interruptions to your access to the Work or Service, and to allow you to pay for
                    other Works or Services you may buy.

                  <li>
                    Works (including, without limitation, Episodes, as defined in the Content
                    Policy) and Services may be purchased on the Platform via Coins. “Coins” are
                    virtual currency available for purchase with your debit or credit card and
                    stored as part of your Account. The price and quantity of Coins you are able to
                    purchase will be communicated to you at the time of sale. Currently, MangaFY
                    offers Coins in two ways: (1) one-time purchases (“One-Time Purchases”), and (2)
                    by selecting one of MangaFY’s automatic refill feature plans (an “Auto-Refilling
                    Plan”). One-Time Purchases of Coins normally do not expire and are redeemable
                    for access to Works at any time, while Coins purchased using an Auto-Refilling
                    Plan will expire in accordance with the terms of the Auto-Refilling Plan you
                    select. However, Coins purchased using the Auto-Refilling Plan are normally
                    offered at lower amounts than One-Time Purchases of Coins, with higher discounts
                    provided when you elect longer Auto-Refilling Plans.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To make purchasing access to Works easier and at a lower cost, you can select an
                    Auto-Refilling Plan with your Account. You can select a weekly, monthly, or
                    yearly Auto-Refilling Plan. For weekly Auto-Refilling Plans, your Account will
                    be automatically charged and refilled weekly and Coins are valid for one (1)
                    week from the date of the refill and thereafter expire. For monthly
                    Auto-Refilling Plans, your Account will be automatically charged and refilled
                    monthly and Coins are valid for one (1) month from the date of the refill and
                    thereafter expire. For yearly Auto-Refilling Plans, your Account will be
                    automatically charged each year and refilled monthly and Coins are valid for one
                    (1) month from the date of the refill and thereafter expire. If you run out of
                    Coins prior to your Account being refilled, you may purchase additional Coins as
                    One-Time Purchases.

                  <li>
                    Once you have selected an Auto-Refilling Plan on our Platform, you will receive
                    an email from the App Store for Apple or the Google Play Store for Google
                    confirming your enrollment in the Auto-Refilling Plan. You will receive an email
                    from the App Store for Apple or the Google Play Store for Google after each
                    refill purchase in accordance with the Auto-Refilling Plan you selected to let
                    you know your Account has refilled and your Account has been charged. You can
                    change your Auto-Refilling Plan or stop the Auto-Refilling Plan through the
                    settings on your individual account via the App Store for Apple or the Google
                    Play Store for Google. However, once Coins have been loaded to your Account, the
                    transaction cannot be reversed and is non-refundable. If you upgrade your
                    Auto-Refilling Plan from a weekly to either monthly or yearly Auto -Refilling
                    Plan, or from a monthly to yearly Auto-Refilling Plan, your Account will be
                    charged a pro-rated amount reflecting the increased rate, and you will be
                    charged the full amount of the new rate beginning with the next billing cycle.

                    third party, including, without limitation, via selling Coins indirectly by
                    selling your Account to any third party. Coins are non-refundable and
                    non-transferable.

                    In addition to these Terms, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotions (each, a
                    “Promotion”) made available by MangaFY through the Platform, or otherwise may
                    have specific rules that are different from these Terms. By participating in a
                    Promotion, you agree to and will become subject to those additional terms and
                    conditions, which will be provided to you when a Promotion is offered. MangaFY
                    urges you to review all rules before you participate in any Promotion. The rules
                    of a specific Promotion will take priority over these Terms in the event of any
                    conflict of the language with a given Promotion.

                    These Terms represent the entire understanding between MangaFY and you,
                    superseding all prior agreements (including previous versions of the Terms),
                    whether oral or written, with respect to your use of the MangaFY and all other
                    subject matter contained herein. The Terms shall be binding upon and inure to
                    the benefit of MangaFY and your respective assigns, successors, heirs, and legal
                    representatives. The Terms cannot be modified or amended, except as expressly
                    provided for herein. The Terms are personal to you and are not assignable,
                    transferable, or sublicensable by you except with MangaFY’s prior written
                    consent. MangaFY may freely assign these Terms. If any part of the Terms is
                    deemed by a court of law to be void, voidable, illegal, or unenforceable, the
                    remainder of the Terms will remain in full effect as if such void, voidable,
                    illegal, or unenforceable part had not existed. The waiver by either party
                    hereto of a breach of any of the provisions of the Terms by the other party
                    hereto shall not be construed as a waiver by the non-breaching party of any

                    property rights, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

                    You consent and agree that: (i) the Terms will be exclusively governed by the
                    laws of New York applicable to contracts entered into and performed within New
                    York and notwithstanding any conflict of law principles; (ii) you accept service

                    right to trial by jury and/or to participate in a class or representative
                    action, and any jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available, excepting
                    only that you and MangaFY may agree in writing that an arbitrator or judge, as
                    applicable pursuant to these Terms, may consolidate more than one person’s
                    claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
                    proceeding. Any dispute arising in connection with or relating in any way to
                    these Terms or to your relationship with MangaFY to the Terms shall be
                    exclusively resolved and heard in New York County, New York.

                  <li>
                    Any alleged claim or cause of action you may have with respect to your use of
                    the Platform must be commenced within one (1) year after the alleged claim or
                    cause of action arises. All rights and remedies are cumulative and shall in no
                    way affect any remedy available to either party under equity or law. You agree
                    that any violation of the breach of the Terms by you will result in irreparable
                    harm to MangaFY that monetary damages may be inadequate, and you hereby agree
                    MangaFY shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief.

                  <li>
                    You and MangaFY agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and
                    MangaFY arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to
                    your relationship with MangaFY (whether based in contract, tort, fraud,
                    misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless if the claims arise
                    during or after the termination of the Terms) will be determined by mandatory
                    binding arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, arbitration may be waived by
                    the mutual written agreement of the parties. In the event this mandatory
                    arbitration provision is invalidated, in whole or in part, by an authority of
                    competent jurisdiction, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and
                    venue for any such dispute, claim, or controversy related to these Terms shall
                    be exclusively governed by the choice of law provisions contained in section
                    18.1 herein.

                  <li>
                    Any arbitration between you and MangaFY will take place under arbitration rules
                    of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”),
                    as modified by the arbitration provisions herein, and the Federal Arbitration
                    Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration policies.
                    The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding
                    with the AAA, appear at adr.org. You and MangaFY agree that the arbitrator shall
                    have the power to rule on any objections with respect to the existence, scope,
                    or validity of the arbitration provisions contained herein or to the
                    arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. The arbitrator must follow these
                    terms and has the power to award the same damages and relief as a court could
                    award (including reasonable attorney fees, as and when specified herein), except
                    that the arbitrator may not award you any declaratory or injunctive relief,
                    unless otherwise explicitly permitted herein. Regardless of the manner in which
                    the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written
                    decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which
                    the decision and award, if any, are based.

                    A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the
                    dispute to the other, by certified mail, or in the event that you have an email
                    address on file as part of your Account, by electronic mail (“Arbitration
                    Notice”). MangaFY’s address for Arbitration Notice is: 335 Madison Avenue, 3rd
                    Floor, New York, New York 10017 c/o Grand Central Tech. The Arbitration Notice
                    must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set
                    forth the specific relief sought. Each party hereto agrees to use good faith
                    efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we are unable to reach an
                    agreement to do so within thirty (30) days after the Arbitration Notice is
                    received, you or MangaFY may commence an arbitration proceeding.

                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the mandatory arbitration referred to herein

                      <li>
                        provided an arbiter or court (if applicable) decides that applicable law
                        precludes enforcement of any of arbitration provisions herein to a
                        particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be
                        severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, in accordance with
                        all choice of law provisions contained herein.
