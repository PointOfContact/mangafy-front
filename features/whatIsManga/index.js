              <strong>First, what is Manga?</strong> Manga is a term describing a variety of
              Japanese comic books and graphic novels. Unlike American comics, which are full color,
              Manga&apos;s are often always published in black and white. Full-color manga is
              reserved for special releases. In addition, Manga series are long-running, spanning
              multiple volumes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The manga became popular worldwide with massive consumption digitally and on printed
              media, surpassing even other forms of comics.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Connecting Manga to Anime.</strong> Anime is a term describing Japanese
              cartoons that are more than often adaptations based on Japanese Manga or graphic
              novels. This became a global phenomenon when Anime started airing in the west on TV
              during the 90s.
            </p>
            <p>Anime is animation. Manga is print. That is the difference.</p>
            <strong>There are five demographics of Manga:</strong>
            <p>
              <strong>Shonen</strong>: A manga that is aimed at tween and teen boys. Common themes
              include coming of age, action, adventure, and friendship. Examples: My Hero Academia,
              Naruto, and Dragon Ball.
            </p>
            <p>
              The plots often use features of action and comedy, with some sort of coming-of-age
              interactions between characters.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Shojo</strong>: A manga that is aimed at tween and teen girls. Common themes
              include Romance, Drama, and Coming of Age. Examples: Salir Moon, Love Hina, Fruits
              Basket.
            </p>
            <p>
              The focus in Shojo is less on the action and more on drama, emotions, and romance.
              Like Shonen, it also features a coming of age story of a young protagonist. The focus
              here is less on the action and more on drama, emotion, and, almost always, idealized
              romance. Like shonen manga, shojo manga usually features the coming-of-age story of a
              young protagonist.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Seinen</strong>: A manga that is targeted at adult men at the ages of 18+.
              Common themes include Action, Violence, Sex, Adult themes. Examples: Akira and
              Berserk.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like Shonen, seinen manga features action and violence, but with a darker and edgier
              content and tone. Whereas the Shonen series often features characters with an
              idealized or innocent worldview, the seinen series will follow a protagonist who must
              face reality and not always save the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Josei</strong>: A manga that is targeted at adult women at the ages of 18+.
              Common themes include Sex, Romance, and Drama. Examples: Loveless.
            </p>
            <p>
              Josei manga features mature narratives that explore romance and personal
              relationships, told in a deeper depth than their Shojo counterparts. Unlike Shojo,
              which often follows a female main character, Josei features both male and female
              protagonists.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Kodomomuke</strong>: A manga that is targeted at children. Examples: Pokemon.
            </p>
            <p>Such a manga will feature cutesy, moralistic, and fun characters and plots.</p>
