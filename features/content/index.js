                    Please see paragraph 2.7 below:
                    <ol>
                      <li>“Free Work” - A Work containing no Paid Content.</li>
                      <li>
                        “Freemium Work” - A Work containing Paid Content based on the Episode Lock
                        Period. After the expiration of the Episode Lock Period, there will no
                        longer be an Access Fee and the Episode becomes “Free”.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        “Premium Work” - A Work with permanently Paid Content that is only ever
                        available to users who have paid the Access Fee for each applicable Episode.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        “Wait-to-Unlock Work” - A Work containing both i) Paid Content based on the
                        Episode Lock Period, and ii) permanently Paid Content. For Paid Content
                        based on the Episode Lock Period, once a user has clicked on any locked
                        Episode, the Episode Lock Period shall begin. After the expiration of the
                        Episode Lock Period, there will no longer be an Access Fee for the Episode
                        the user previously clicked on, and such Episode will become "Free" Content
                        for said user. Once the user has accessed such subsequent Episode, the
                        Episode Lock Period shall begin again, and such process shall continue for
                        all remaining Episodes in the Work, excepting any Episodes that you
                        designate as permanently Paid Content. (For example purposes only, for a
                        Work consisting of thirty (30) Episodes, with ten (10) Episodes therein of
                        permanently Paid Content, once a user has read the first three (3) Episodes
                        in their entirety, you may designate an Episode Lock Period of twelve (12)
                        hours to begin. Following the expiration of such twelve (12) hours, the user
                        may access an Episode of their choosing without charge, excluding any Paid
                        Content. When such user accesses the fourth Episode of a Work, an Episode
                        Lock Period of twelve (12) hours will occur again before the user can access
                        the fifth Episode of the Work without charge. This process would continue
                        for each Episode until the user reaches the final ten (10) Episodes of the
                        Work, which then may only be accessed following payment of the Access Fee by
                        the User.)

                        The first three (3) Episodes of each Work for any Pricing Model selected
                        will be made available free to all users of the Platform. The Access Fee
                        shall apply starting with the fourth Episode of each Work and onward. The
                        first three Episodes of each Work may be made available by you and otherwise
                        published outside of the Platform for promotional purposes.

                    The designation of a Pricing Model shall remain for the duration of that Work’s
                    distribution and publication on the Platform; however, you may request to change
                    the Pricing Model for a Work by writing to us at{' '}

                    eligible for a change of Pricing Model once per Work. We also shall have the
                    right, in our sole discretion, to determine the timing of any change to a
                    Pricing Model, and such change may be delayed for any reason, including, without
                    limitation, to allow users of the Platform to access the Work for a period of
                    time based on your initial Pricing Model designation. You acknowledge and agree
                    that you will engage in no act, including, without limitation, requesting a

                  <li>
                    For the avoidance of doubt, only a Work receives a Pricing Model designation and

                    You are responsible for the marketing of your Content and the growth of your
                    readership. MangaFY shall have no obligation whatsoever to assist you in
                    marketing your Content.

                  <li>
                    In consideration for making your Content available on the Platform, you shall be
                    entitled to the following revenue share (“Revenue Share”): the number of Coins
                    paid for Paid Content under the Freemium Work and Premium Work Publication
                    Types, multiplied by 0.042 United States Dollars (USD). For instance, if users
                    of the Platform spend one hundred (100) Coins on your Paid Content, your Revenue
                    Share shall be $4.20 USD. We reserve the right to modify this Revenue Share at
                    any time in our sole discretion; however, for changes to the Revenue Share only,
                    you will be given one (1) month notice prior to any changes to your Revenue
                    Share.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Subject to your compliance with all terms and conditions contained herein,
                    MangaFY shall pay you your Revenue Share on a quarterly basis, typically within
                    five (5) business days at the start of each quarter for Revenue Share accrued in
                    the previous quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MangaFY will not be
                    required to pay you any Revenue Share for any accounting period in which your
                    total accrued Revenue Share is less than One Thousand One Hundred and Ninety
                    (1,190) Coins (“Minimum Coins”), which is currently equivalent to $50.00 USD.
                    Any withheld Coins/Revenue Share shall be carried forward to the next accounting
                    period and will be payable as part of a future Revenue Share distribution when
                    your account meets or exceeds the Minimum Coins.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In the event MangaFY makes any overpayment of Revenue Share, MangaFY may deduct
                    the overpayment from future distributions of Revenue Share, and/or may ask you
                    to promptly reimburse MangaFY.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Your Revenue Share shall be paid in United States Dollars and transferred via
                    your chosen payment method. Your account details and payment method of choice
                    must be submitted to MangaFY within 7 to 14 working days of your request for
                    payment. Payment shall be made in United States Dollars (US$). You are
                    responsible for any fees (e.g. wire transfer and EFT fees) charged by your bank
                    related to such remittances. We will not be liable to you in the event that the
                    proceeds you receive are lower than you anticipated on account of payment
                    processing costs.

                  <li>
                    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, we do not make any
                    guarantees with respect to the timing of receipt of funds, which may be subject
                    to payment processing or other delays. You acknowledge and agree not take any
                    actions in reliance on the receipt of funds until you are in receipt of cleared
                    funds. In the event of chargebacks, fraud, cancellations, or returns, the value
                    originally paid to Author for the corresponding sale shall be deducted from
                    first amounts otherwise due the Author in the month in which the return
                    occurred.

                    Any Revenue Share payment or statement shall be binding on you and not subject
                    to objection for any reason unless such objection is made in writing stating the
                    basis thereof and delivered to MangaFY within twelve (12) months from delivery
                    of such Revenue Share payment or statement.

                    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, MangaFY shall have

                    applicable tax laws.

                    authority anywhere in the world for any income tax, employee insurance or any
                    other deduction or withholding required to be made by law (including any
                    interest and/or penalties thereon) arising in respect of payments made or to be
                    made to you, YOU UNDERTAKE AND AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS MangaFY
                    AND/OR THE GROUP AGAINST SUCH TAX AND INSURANCE AND SHALL, AT THE WRITTEN
                    REQUEST OF MangaFY IMMEDIATELY PAY MangaFY AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO ANY TAX AND
                    INSURANCE PAID OR PAYABLE BY MangaFY OR ANY OTHER GROUP COMPANY TO SUCH TAXING
                    AUTHORITY. The foregoing indemnity obligation does not limit, and is in addition
