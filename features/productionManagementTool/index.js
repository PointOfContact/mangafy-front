            </p>
            <h3>First, what is the MangaFY Production Management Tool?</h3>
            <p>
              MangaFY is a collaboration platform, but also a management tool to provide artists
              with a one-stop shop for the production of your story from an idea into a fully
              ready-to-be publishing novel. The tool allows you to easily manage your script, page
              outline, characters, and proper flow to work and communicate with your fellow team
              members (be it illustrators, editors, translators, etc).
            </p>
            <h3>How can I reach the mangmant tool on MangaFY?</h3>
            <p>Easily, go stright into your desired project and enter it:</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <Imgix
              width={860}
              height={400}
              src={'https://mangafy.club/img/articleProProject.png'}
              alt="MangaFy projects"
            />
            <p>
              Once you are inside your project go to upper bar and select
              <strong> STORY BOARD</strong> option:
            </p>
            <Imgix
              width={860}
              height={740}
              src={'https://mangafy.club/img/articleProStoryBoard.png'}
              alt="MangaFy card story board"
            />
            <p>
              From here, it's pretty straightforward as we kept it simple and organized to have a
              suitable follow to for you and your team to work on your project through 6 simple
              sections:
            </p>
            <div className={styles.smallPhoto}>
              <Imgix
                width={560}
                height={600}
                src={'https://mangafy.club/img/articleProStoryBoardTwo.png'}
                alt="MangaFy card story board"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              The first section is the <strong>story bible and plot management</strong>. Here you
              write the bible (world overview) of your story).
            </p>
            <p>
              Second section of the story bible is to <strong>define your characters:</strong>
            </p>
            <Imgix
              width={860}
              height={750}
              src={'https://mangafy.club/img/articleCreateCards.png'}
              alt="MangaFy create cards"
            />
            <p>
              Enter characters of your tale, from main to secondary and background characters you
              wish to include into the production of your tale. Give them names and story
              backgrounds that will help your team and illustrators understanding the concept you
              aim to achieve.
            </p>
            <p>
              Third stage is the <strong>Manga and Page layout script</strong>. Define how many
              pages your work will include, add the text and scene description for each page so your
              team can draw and illustrate it.
            </p>
            <Imgix
              width={860}
              height={720}
              src={'https://mangafy.club/img/articleCreateScript.png'}
              alt="MangaFy create script"
            />
            <p>
              The fourth stage is the <strong>digital illustration</strong> section. You can use any
              of the sample templates provided and of course you and your team can upload and
              customize your own. Matching between the page and scene scripts and their panel
              illustrations smoothly and easily in one accessible place.
            </p>
            <Imgix
              width={860}
              height={840}
              src={'https://mangafy.club/img/articleBackground.png'}
              alt="MangaFy background"
            />
            <p>
              The next step is to <strong>upload and organize your team's digital work</strong>.
              Compiling it into one finalized and ready to be published manga or comic book.

              width={860}
              height={820}
              src={'https://mangafy.club/img/articleUpload.png'}
              alt="MangaFy upload"
            />

              can leave comments to one another.
            </p>
            <Imgix
              width={860}
              height={600}
              src={'https://mangafy.club/img/articleComment.png'}
              alt="MangaFy comment"
